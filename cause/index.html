        <p>I support renaming the term "AI" in Turkish from "Yapay Zeka" (current translation) to "Akl-ı Sunî" which makes me a "Mühendis-i Akl-ı Sunî" which is translated as "AI Engineer". You can support this very special cause of mine by using "Akl-ı Sunî" instead of "Yapay Zeka".</p>
        <p>Here is a very cool design about this</p>

            This website is actually <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this website</a>.
            I thank the creators of that website: <a href="https://twitter.com/drew_mc">Drew McConville</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gabehammersmith">Gabe Hammersmith</a>.
            That website also has its own 'this website' but since the creators of my website's 'this website' probably already thanked the creator(s) of their website's 'this website' in their website (which is my website's 'this website'), I will not be thanking the creator(s) of 'this website' of my website's 'this website' specifically since I automatically thanked them by extension (also known as chain thanking).
